# Strands

Strands is a reference implementation of a robust CI/CD pipeline which allows Decentralized Apps to be deployed on the ICON blockchain.

The sample application used for this implementation is the Icon Daedric Price Oracle while also supporting AWS infrastructure.


## Tech Stack
This implementation uses:

* CircleCI
* Terraform 
* Docker
* Ansible
* AWS


## Motivation

According to the [state of DevOps 2019 report](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf):
organizations that practice CI/CD produce higher quality software more quickly.

unfortunately, certain industried, such as the Blockchain industry, are devoid of open-source CI/CD tools. 
This project aims to address that issue by providing a reference implementation for the deployment of Decentralized Applications
